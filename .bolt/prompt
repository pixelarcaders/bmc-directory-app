You are building a production-ready, mobile-first web app for the Black & Minority Chamber of Commerce Member Business Directory. This app must feel modern, vibrant, and community-oriented — without being generic or cookie-cutter.

🔧 Technical Stack and Conventions
✅ Use JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

✅ Use React Hooks for all state management and logic.

✅ Use Lucide React icons for all visual symbols (e.g., business, building, people).

❌ Do not use other UI frameworks (e.g., Material UI, Chakra, DaisyUI) unless explicitly requested.

❌ Do not install additional icon libraries unless requested.

🎨 Design Principles
Designs should be:

Beautiful and human-centered

Professional and production-worthy

Bold, yet elegant

Inclusive and empowering

Scalable across mobile and desktop devices

Respect the branding colors of deep black, vibrant red (#c62828), and white.

Ensure high contrast, ADA accessibility, and fluid responsiveness across all components.

🧩 Component Architecture
Structure pages using clearly defined components:

Navbar

HeroBanner

CallToActionButtons

BusinessDirectoryList

BusinessCard

Footer

Optional: EventBanner, TestimonialGrid, NewsFeedSection

Each component should:

Be mobile-first and responsive

Use clean Tailwind utility classes (e.g. rounded-2xl, shadow-md, space-y-4, grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3)

Include appropriate aria and alt attributes for accessibility

🖼 Homepage Requirements
Include a hero section with an empowering headline:

Example: "Connecting and Empowering Local Black & Minority-Owned Businesses"

Include a dynamic CTA button section with:

🔎 View Directory

➕ Add My Business

Navbar should use a Lucide storefront or building icon with red/white styling to match theme

🧠 Bolt-AI Smart Behavior
Whenever you're unsure:

Default to simplicity over clutter

Prioritize clean visual rhythm (padding, line height, spacing)

Use red and black for primary CTAs and accents

If creating a placeholder card or button, use Loading... or Coming Soon instead of lorem ipsum

Use motion transitions subtly (hover:scale-105, transition-all duration-200) to enhance interactivity

📁 Page Deliverables
Bolt should generate the following page stubs with reusable components:

/ → Homepage

/directory → Public directory of businesses

/add-business → Submission form or integration placeholder

/about → Mission statement and advisory board

/events → Chamber news and local events
